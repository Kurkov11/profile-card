## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned how to put one div behind another div in a container. I've set the conatainer's position to relative and content's position to absolute. This way the background stayed behind the content.

### Continued development

I must work on the ability to center multiple elements. I didn't really know how to approach the bottom part of design so that likes would be in the center and both photos and followers will be centered neatly in the leftover space. 

As of now the space between followers and likes is bigger than the space between likes and photos.
